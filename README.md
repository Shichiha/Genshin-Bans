If you want to contribute to Genshin-Bans, please open a pull request.

Make sure that:
Images must have file names in the format of `<20_random_characters>-<7_random_characters>.<extension>`

where `<20_random_characters>` is a random string of 20 characters and `<7_random_characters>` is a random string of 7 characters;

in the middle of the string, there must be a hyphen; and <extension> is the extension of the image, in this case, an image format such as `.png` or `.jpg`

If there is a duplicate image, you can open an Issue about it, including the two images' names
